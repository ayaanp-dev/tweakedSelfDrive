THIS IS NOT AWESOME CODE...

Also, I deleted the training_data.npy as I use the balanced_training_data.npy, which is in the repo, for training.  So if you go to like create_training_data or
balance_data.py, don't mind that it used training_data.npy

In addition, i deleted the trained mooel, which is called xception2_net, because it exceeds file limit, so don't worry if you see a program using xception2_net

This is tweaked as I tweaked it a lot, but the base is from https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5/tree/master/Versions/v0.03
