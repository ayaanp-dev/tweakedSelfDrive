This is a self driving car I have made!

Do note that this doesn't work on a real car, of course.  This project is being tested on your screen, so like some car game.
I am working on testing as it is kinda funky, but that should be fixed soon.

If you have any problems or solutions or whatever, please feel free to make an issue or if it is more code, make a pull request!

This is a tweaked version of https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5/
